Intro: I am a confident, passionate, and dedicated software engineer.

What were you doing in the past: I was a an attorney before I decided to change my career  path. 

Why I am changing my career path: However, I started to teach myself how to code on my commute to and from work. Slowly over the course of several months I realized my favorite part of the day
was my commute, and that certainly was not because of the  one hour and 15 minute train ride to and from work. From that moment on, I decided to steps that would allow me to become a software engineer. I continued to teach myself how to code, and then I enrolled at fullstack academy to further my training.

What am I looking for now: I hope that I will be able to apply my technical skills in a challenging yet rewarding software engineering position. I would love to get coffee and pick your brain about being a software engineer or software engineering.
